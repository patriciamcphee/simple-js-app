# Simple JS app

## Description of project
This was my first achievement project for the CareerFoundry Fullstack Web Development Immersion module. The project was to build a small web application Pok√©dex with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API. The app was designed for viewing of data points in detail in a simplistic UI. 

## List of technologies used

- HTML/CSS Bootstrap 4

- Javascript/JQuery

- GitHub/GitHub Pages

- VSCode (integrated with GitHub)
## How the project was organized and managed

The project brief provided the user goals, key features, and technical requirements. It also provided mock-ups for a simple design, but we were given creative freedom with our own layout.
